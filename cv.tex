\subsubsection*{Employment History}
\textbf{February 2019 -- November 2022:} Demonstrating in labs and running tutorials for several courses at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em] %topsep sets space between above paragraph and list
	\item 2019--2022 Semester 1: 200 level Biological Data Analysis (Lab Demonstrator)
	\item 2020--2022 Semester 2: 300 level Biological Data Analysis (Lab Demonstrator)
	\item 2021 \& 2022 Semester 1: 300 level Global Change and Biosecurity (Lab Demonstrator)
	\item 2019 Semester 2: 100 level Discrete Mathematics (Tutor)
	\item 2019 Semester 2: 200 \& 400 level Data Wrangling (Lab Demonstrator)
\end{itemize}
My main duty in each case was to attend computer labs and tutorials, and to assist students in completing their assigned work and understanding the course material.
In the computer labs (all courses except discrete mathematics) a lecturer was present to lead the labs, but in the tutorials (discrete mathematics and 200 level biological data analysis) I was independently leading them.
In most cases, the material the students were to work on was prepared by lecturers, but I was occasionally required to prepare revision material for the 200 level biological data analysis tutorials.
For the data wrangling course, I was given the opportunity to prepare and give a 2 hour lecture on a relevant topic of my choice: use of the shell (specifically Bash).

\textbf{December 2017 -- November 2018:}
Part-time independent contractor for QuickSense Education, while based in Christchurch, New Zealand.
My task was to devise and write practice questions, answers and explanations for NCEA Level 1--3 students in Mathematics, Biology, Physics and Statistics.

\textbf{2014 Easter school break:}
Work for Cyclone Computers (Christchurch, New Zealand) to upgrade the computers for researchers and other staff members at Lincoln University.
I performed the entire upgrade process, including backing up data, transferring it to the new computers, and loading any software the researchers required onto the new computers according to individual researchers' requests.

\subsubsection*{Other Research Experience}
\textbf{March 2023 -- present:}
I am currently preparing both chapters of my Masters thesis as papers for publication.
The first has been submitted for publication already but has thus far been rejected.
I am currently addressing reviewer comments before submitting to another journal.

\textbf{November 2019 -- February 2020:}
Completed a Summer Research Scholarship in the Stouffer Lab at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
I pursued an independent project, investigating the effect of spatial structure on coexistence theory.
I developed software to perform agent-based modelling of species competition with spatial structure, and compared the results to those yielded by traditional models without spatial structure.
I am currently writing these results in a papers for publication, as an ongoing project.

\textbf{November 2018 -- February 2019:}
Completed a Summer Research Scholarship in the Stouffer Lab at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.
I extensively modified a piece of network alignment software (muritz, originally developed by another member of the lab group), primarily to improve its computation speed on large networks, and applied it to food webs and metabolic networks.
