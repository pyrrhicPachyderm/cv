\subsubsection*{Profile}
I am a self motivated, high achieving student, with a sharp attention to detail.
I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Ecology as a member of the Stouffer Lab at the University of Canterbury.
I achieved A+ level in all my courses during the taught year of my Master's, and am currently writing my thesis during my second year.
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Canterbury reading for a triple major in Mathematics, Biology and Computer Science.
I completed 495 points across 31 courses, all at A+ level.

I have represented New Zealand three times at the International Olympiad in Informatics (algorithmic design and implementation).
I graduated from Christ's College, Canterbury as Proxime Accessit, achieving Excellence at NCEA Level 3 with Excellence endorsements in Calculus, Statistics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
