\subsubsection*{Profile}
I am a self motivated, high achieving student, with a sharp attention to detail.
I am currently in my third year of undergraduate study at the University of Canterbury reading for a triple major in Mathematics, Biology and Computer Science.
I have completed 375 points across 19 courses, all at A+ level.
Following a Summer Research Scholarship, I am continuing an ongoing project as a member of the Stouffer Lab.

I have represented New Zealand three times at the International Olympiad in Informatics (algorithmic design and implementation).
I graduated from Christ's College, Canterbury as Proxime Accessit, achieving Excellence at NCEA Level 3 with Excellence endorsements in Calculus, Statistics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

\subsubsection*{Employment \& Research Experience}
\textbf{February 2019 -- present:} Demonstrating in labs and running tutorials for several courses at the University of Canterbury.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0em] %topsep sets space between above paragraph and list
	\item 2019 Semester 1: 200 level Biological Data Analysis
	\item 2019 Semester 2: 100 level Discrete Mathematics
	\item 2019 Semester 2: 200 \& 400 level Data Wrangling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{November 2018 -- February 2019:}
Completed a Summer Research Scholarship in the Stouffer Lab at the University of Canterbury.
I extensively modified the network alignment code and applied it to food webs and metabolic networks.
I am writing an application note about the aligner for publication, as an ongoing project.

\textbf{December 2017 -- November 2018:}
Part-time work at QuickSense Education, writing practice questions and explanations for NCEA Level 1--3 students in Mathematics, Biology, Physics and Statistics.

\textbf{2014 Easter school break:}
Worked for Cyclone Computers to upgrade the computers for professors and other staff members at Lincoln University.

%This required a range of skills, such as communicating with professors and other staff members to find which software they used, backing up important data, physically replacing hardware, installing new operating systems, migrating data and assorted pieces of software.
